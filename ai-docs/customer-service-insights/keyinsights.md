The homepage (preview) of Dynamics 365 Customer Service Insights presents insights from your customer service data in a visually rich way, making it easier to discover topic issues to focus on and why they are suggested. 

At the top of the page, you can find workspace information on nubmer of case data imported, number of topics discovered, and percentage of cases that were successfully clusterd to find the topics. 
* **Workspace:**  name of your environment with your customer service data.
* **Case collected:** number of total cases imported into this workspace, using the method of all cases created in the last 60 days or up to 1 million cases, whichever's great. See more details around limits [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/ai/customer-service-insights/service-limits).
* **Topics:** number of topics discovered from percentage of total imported cases that were successfully clustered based on semantic similarity. 
* **Time period selectors:** enable comparison between the selected time period and the previous period to see how KPIs are changing over time as well as across different time ranges. The default selection is "Last 7 days", based on the creation date of cases imported since the last refresh. 
  * Last 24 hours
  * Last 7 days
  * Last 30 days
* **Time period range:** based on the selected time period, this shows the time range (in UTC time zone) of the imported cases that were used to discover topic issues shown on the page.  
* **Refreshed date:** this timestamp indicates when the workspace was last refreshed, cases created up until the last refresh date are imported to the workspace, which are used to calculate AI and BI insights.
