# Connector to Azure Blob storage

VALUE PROP and CATEGORIZATION

## Configure the connector to Azure Blob Storage

1. On the **Export destinations** page, locate **Azure Blob Storage** and select **Set up**.

1. Enter **Account name**, **Account key**, and **Container** for your Azure Blob Storage account.
    - To learn more about how to find the Azure Blob Storage account name and account key, see [Manage storage account settings in the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-manage).
    - To learn how to create a container, see [Create a container](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal#create-a-container).

1. Give your destination a recognizable name in the **Display name** field.

1. Select **Next**.

1. Select the box next to each of the entities you want to export to this destination.

1. Select **Save**.

Exported data is stored in the Azure Blob Storage container you configured. The following folder paths are automatically created in your container:

- Entities generated by Customer Insights: Dynamics365CustomerInsights/Export/%EntityName%/%EntityName%_%PartitionId%.csv
  - Example: Dynamics365CustomerInsights/Export/Customer/Customer_1.csv
- Source entities: Dynamics365CustomerInsights/Export/%DataSourceName%_%EntityName%/%DataSourceName%_%EntityName%_%PartitionId%.csv
  - Example: Dynamics365CustomerInsights/Export/Retail_Contacts/Retail_Contacts_1.csv

## Export the data

You can [export data on demand](export-destinations.md), or in [scheduled intervals](pm-settings.md#schedule-tab).
