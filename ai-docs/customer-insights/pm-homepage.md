# Home

The first page you see in the Dynamics 365 Customer Insights app is **Home**. The Home page gives you a holistic view of your customer base and metrics to track the health of your business.

## Change between environments

You can switch from a demo environment to your live environments if you want to work with data of your customers, given they've already been [set up and configured](pm-data-sources.md). Select the **Environment** control in the upper-right corner of the page to change environments.

## Explore the home page

To see insights on the home page, take a few moments to [add data sources](pm-data-sources.md), [unify](pm-configure-data.md), and [enrich your data](pm-enrichment.md).

First, you should create a unified dataset of your customers out of datasets that are currently siloed and disconnected. Then you can use capabilities such as *Measures*, *Enrichment*, and *Activities* to unlock richer insights. Use capabilities such as *Segments* and *Customers* to act on the new insights.

Insights on the home page usually contain the following information:

- **Aggregated insights**: Tiles with business insights that you define on the **Measures** page. Only Business measures will show up here. They can include predictive key performance indicators (KPIs) such as average likelihood of customer churn.
- **Insights about brands and interests**: This unique information can be unlocked using the **Enrichment** capabilities after completing the *Map*, *Match*, and *Merge* phases.  
- **Customer segments**: Includes segments that were created around your customers. For more information on how to create additional segments, see the [Segments](pm-segments.md) article.

## Next step

Many of the home page insights are dependent upon the completion of the data configuration process, and this process in turn is based on first loading data into Customer Insights. See the [Data Sources](pm-data-sources.md) topic to learn how to add data sources.
