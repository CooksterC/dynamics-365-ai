# Power Automate connector (preview)

Power Automate is now integrated with Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, and available as an admin control to be informed on the refresh of data sources.

Power Automate integration lets you configure simple flows through a direct link to the Customer Insights connector and triggers in Power Automate.

## Create a Power Automate flow in Customer Insights

1. In Customer Insights, go to **Admin** > **System**.
2. On the **System** page, select the **Status** tab.
3. Above the **Data Sources** section, select **Flows** and select **Create a flow** from the dropdown list.
4. In the Power Automate app, select one of the available triggers to create your preferred flow. If you're creating your first flow, you'll need to authenticate with the Power Automate connector first.
