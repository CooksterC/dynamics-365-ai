# Power BI connector

In this section, you'll learn how to use the Dynamics 365 Customer Insights connector in Power BI to combine Customer Insights unified data with Power BIâ€™s data visualization capabilities.

The Customer Insights connector lets you use the unified data that you've unlocked through the data configuration process. This data includes customer details, such as roles, locations, and any unique key performance indicators (KPIs) you've defined on the **Measures** page (such as Customer Lifetime Spend or Engagement Score).

In order to see your customer insights in Power BI, make sure that you've created at least one data source within the **Data sources** page and ingested at least one dataset (entity) into it. Also ensure you have [Microsoft Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/) installed on your computer. Then, complete the following steps:

1. Open Microsoft Power BI Desktop and select **Get Data** in the menu at the top of the page.

2. Search for **Dynamics 365 Customer Insights**, select it from the menu on the right, and then select **Connect** on the lower-right corner.

3. If you haven't used this connector before, you'll need to sign in with the same account you use to view the data in Customer Insights.

4. You'll see a list of all the environments you can access. You can select the arrow next to any of the environments to see a full list of entities you can import.

5. Select the check boxes next to the entities you want to load, and then select **Load** in the lower-right corner of the dialog box. You can select multiple entities from multiple environments.

6. You'll see a loading dialog box while your entities are loaded. Once all of your selected entities have loaded, you'll have the capabilities of Power BI combined with your data from Customer Insights.
