Auto capture helps sales personnel in your organization to add relevant customer activities to Dynamics 365 Sales by capturing emails and meetings from Outlook.
Auto capture is available in two forms:

-	**Auto capture**: This feature is available for free with Sales Insights on Dynamics 365 Sales. To learn more, see [How to enable Auto capture](#how-to-enable-auto-capture).

-	**Premium auto capture**: Premium auto capture is available as a preview with Sales Insights on Dynamics 365 Sales. To learn more, see [How to enable and configure premium auto capture](#how-to-enable-and-configure-premium-auto-capture).
