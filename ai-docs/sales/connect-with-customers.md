# Connect with customers through a record or the up next widget 

As a seller, you can connect with your customers by using multiple channels, such as phone and email daily without losing context and switching to multiple application. If you have activities to contact customers through a phone call or an email, corresponding icons and buttons of phone and email are displayed in your engagement center and the Up next widget. After you make the phone call or send an email, you must mark the activity as complete in the **Up next** widget and continue with the next activity defined in the sequence.

If an activity is not required to be completed by the due date or you are unable to connect with a customer, you can either skip or postpone the activity. More information: [Skip or postpone an activity](#skip-or-postpone-an-activity)

The mobile phone number   of the contact is used to initiate the call. If the mobile phone number of the contact   is not available, the softphone dialer is displayed,   and you can dial the number manually.

After you make the phone call successfully, you must mark the Phone Call activity as complete.
