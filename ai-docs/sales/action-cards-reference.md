# Insight cards reference

Insight cards help keep you up to date with your work in Dynamics 365 Sales, letting you know when you need to follow up on an email, attend a meeting, and much more. They're displayed throughout the application to provide relevant information for the context you're working in. The cards are generated by the assistant<!--Is there a reason not to use "Sales Insights" in the assistant name?--> based on data stored in Dynamics 365 Sales and your [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] inbox and calendar. This topic lists each of the available cards and provides details about what each card does, how it gets generated, and how you can use it. More information: [Use Sales Insights Assistant to guide customer communications](assistant.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Your system administrator must enable the assistant before you can try it out. For prerequisites, how to enable the feature, and how to set it up, see [Configure Sales Insights Assistant](configure-assistant.md).  

The assistant displays cards in the following categories:<!--Not "typically," unless there are exceptions that you're willing to explain.-->

- [Upcoming meetings](#upcoming-meetings)

- [Reminders](#reminders)

- [Insights](#insights)
  
## Upcoming meetings

The following cards are available under **Upcoming meetings**.
<!--These tables will be nearly unreadable on mobile devices. Can we think about options for making it narrower? If we took away the "Availability" column, we could move the product name so it would be the first line in the Description column, or break the table in two and have one for D365 Sales and one for D365 Sales Insights table. Or maybe we could reduce the width of the graphics by a fourth or a third? I'd be glad to experiment with that.-->
