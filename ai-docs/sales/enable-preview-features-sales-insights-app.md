# Enable coming soon features

Sometimes coming soon features that change the look, feel, or functionality of the application, are added to the Dynamics 365 Conversation Intelligence application before the formal release.

As an administrator, activating **Coming soon** mode gives users in your organization early access to these new features, allowing them to share feedback with us before the changes are formally released. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you’ve already enabled **Coming soon** mode during your first-run set up, you’re not required to enable it again; however, you can disable **Coming soon** mode in your organization  if you don’t wish to experience the new features that are yet to be released.

**Follow these steps**:

> [!NOTE]
> If you have already enabled the preview feature through first-run set up, you are not required to enable it again; however, you can disable it if you don’t wish to use it in your organization.

1.	Review the prerequisites. To learn more, see [Prerequisites to configure Conversation intelligence application](prereq-sales-insights-app.md).

2.	Open the **Dynamics 365 Conversation Intelligence** application. 

3.	Select the **Settings** icon on the top-right of the page and then select **Settings**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select settings option](media/si-app-admin-select-settings.png "Select settings option")
 
4.	On the **Settings** page, select **Coming soon**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select coming soon option](media/si-app-admin-select-preview-feature.png "Select coming soon option")

5.	To enable, select **Get early access to new features before they’re released to all our customers** and then select **Save**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Coming soon feature enabled](media/si-app-admin-preview-feature-enabled.png "Coming soon feature enabled")

    The **Coming soon** mode is enabled. Users in your organization can try and use new features that will be released later.
