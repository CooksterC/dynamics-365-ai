# Capture customer related activities with auto capture

Auto capture simplifies logging customer related activities into Dynamics 365 Sales by providing activity suggestions for emails and meetings related to your work from your Microsoft Exchange. This helps to see your relevant emails and messages together with all the other activities that are related to a given record on Timeline.
The activity suggestions remain private and visible only to you until you choose to track email or meeting. You can save suggestions and make email or meeting visible to everyone who has access to the specific record that the suggestion is added to. 

Auto capture allows sales personnel to focus their time on selling by logging every customer-related activity. You can capture customer interactions, such as emails and meetings, and display them on Timeline for appropriate records pertaining to **Contact**, **Opportunity**, **Lead**, **Account**, **Case**, and Custom entities.
Auto capture is part of the Sales Insights suite of features and is available in two forms:

•	[Basic auto capture](free-auto-capture.md)

•	[Premium auto capture](premium-auto-capture.md) 

The administrator must enable auto capture features before you can try it out. For complete details about prerequisites, how to enable the feature, and how to set it up, see [Enable and configure auto capture](configure-auto-capture.md).
